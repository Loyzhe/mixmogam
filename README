This package contains tools for performing mixed model association mapping, originally developed for Arabidopsis thaliana, but can easily be applied to other organisms, including Humans.  

The current release is pre-beta, and will need editing in order to run, as I left some imported files out which I plan to decouple from the current code in the near future.  I also plan to clean this code up and generalize it, as currently the raw code includes various old test functions.  A number of functions is also directly related to the A. thaliana dataset I've been working, and that needs to be decoupled.

The main dependencies are:
* scipy
* matplotlib
